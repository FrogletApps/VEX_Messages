# VEX_Messages

This is an Arduino project designed to sit on Team ROUSE's desk at the VEX World Championships 2016!
It can display random messages when the Arduino is moved, or play the UK National Anthem (with lyrics), and also the Portal 2 end theme (Want You Gone), because why not...
A tiny part of the Portal 1 end theme (Still Alive) was also made, but wouldn't fit on the Arduino :(

Hardware Used:
Arduino Nano
Buzzer
Tilt Switch
16x2 LCD screen

If you fancy making your own version, attach these and you can change the pin numbers at the top of the VEX Worlds file to change it.
